            <h1>My journey In the Tech</h1>
  <p>
    My journey into tech began in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, where I started as a Network Engineer Apprentice at 
    <strong>SOCITECH-CI</strong>. There, I gained foundational experience in networking, system maintenance, and
    troubleshooting. I later managed a cyber café, which allowed me to stay actively engaged with technology while
    helping others navigate digital tools. After relocating to the U.S., I redirected my focus toward web development.
    While I have not yet held a professional role in the field, I’ve developed strong hands-on experience by
    consistently building and refining my own coding projects.

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a native French speaker and fluent in English, which enables me to communicate effectively with people from
    diverse backgrounds. I'm passionate about creativity in all its forms — from designing web applications to writing
    and storytelling, even exploring ideas for film scripts. I regularly share my work and ideas on
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thestories_teller?igsh=MTJwOWt4dmRoMnVzeg%3D%3D&utm_source=qr">Instagram</a> and
    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@the.stories.telle0?_t=ZP-8xoux90OYZy&_r=1">TikTok</a>, where you're welcome to follow and connect.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to web development, I operate an online business where I design and manage Shopify stores. If you’re
    looking for a clean, conversion-focused online shop, I’d be happy to help. There’s no need for expensive themes or
    complicated setups — all you need is your product and <strong>ME</strong> to bring it to life.
  </p>

  <p>
  Alongside building personal projects and pursuing freelance work, I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute to a collaborative team, continue growing professionally, and make a real impact.
